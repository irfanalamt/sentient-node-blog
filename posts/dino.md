You're not alone if you've ever wondered what it's like to be a T-Rex. After all, who wouldn't want to be the dinosaurs' king? But, before you start fantasising, here are a few things you should know about T-Rex life.

To begin with, if you're a T-Rex, you should expect to be quite large. The largest T-Rex ever discovered was approximately **12 metres long** and weighed over **7000 kilogrammes**. That's a lot of weight to be carrying! Furthermore, due to T-Rexes' **notoriously small brain**, you can expect to be a little slow on the uptake.

Also, if you’re a T-Rex, prepare to be a bit of a loner. Despite their intimidating size, T-Rexes were **solitary animals**, and usually only interacted with other dinosaurs to fight or hunt for food. So if you’re looking for a friend, you may want to look elsewhere.

Finally, if you’re a T-Rex, you can expect to have some **serious chomping power**. T-Rexes had some of the strongest jaws ever discovered, which allowed them to crush bones and other hard materials with ease. So if you ever find yourself in a pinch, you’ll be glad that you have T-Rex jaws!

> ⚡If you’re looking for a way to channel your inner dinosaur, being a T-Rex just might be the way to go.
