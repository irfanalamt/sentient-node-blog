You know those moments when you're just going about your day and all of a sudden, BOOM! Something explodes in the sky and it feels like the entire universe is screaming at you? That's a supernova, baby.

But what exactly is a supernova?<br/> It's essentially the **death of a star**, but it goes out with a massive explosion that's out of this world (literally). In fact, the **energy released** during a supernova is **more** than **our Sun will release in its entire lifetime**. Talk about epic.

But how does a star even become a supernova?<br/>It depends on its size. If a star is **at least eight times** the **mass** of **our Sun**, it will end with a bang as it collapses in on itself and sends shockwaves and debris flying through space.<br/>
On the other hand, if a star is **less massive**, it will have a less explosive death, shedding its outer layers and leaving behind a **white dwarf**.

The cool part: the explosion from a supernova is so powerful that it can create new elements. That's right, **all the heavy elements** in the universe, like gold and silver (and even the iron in your blood), were created by supernovas.
