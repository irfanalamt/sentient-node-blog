- Chimps will make **alarming vocalizations** and gaze at a threat and then back at their group until other chimps take notice. A study also discovered that chimps will give more warnings about **threats** to chimps who are **friends or family**.
- Quoting Catherine Crockford(researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology):

  > "The motivation to keep friends **safe**, to stop them being taken away by others, probably occupies quite a lot of their day and their brain work. Itâ€™s a really crucial part of survival."

- The idea that an animal can understand another animal's point of view well enough to adjust its calls accordingly is quite remarkable!
