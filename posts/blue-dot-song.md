- [Voyager1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_1) is the **farthest human-made** object from Earth.
- It continues to ring home with new information about the universe!
- It carries a **golden record** that tells the **story of humanity** through sounds, images, and science.
- It includes **natural sounds**, a **baby's cry**, a **kiss**, **greetings** in a variety of languages, and one whale language.
- Contains over 100 **analog-encoded visuals** that describe ourselves and what we are.
- A graphic on the record's aluminium cover describes **how to play** it and **where it comes from.**
- President Jimmy Carter on the _Voyager golden record_:

> "This is a **present** from a **small, distant world,** a token of our sounds, our science, our images, our music, our **thoughts** and our **feelings**. We are attempting to survive our **time** so we may live **into yours**."
