- [Voyager1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_1) was a NASA space probe that was launched to explore the interstellar area beyond our solar system's outer planets. It is the **farthest human-made** object from Earth.
- It is now 157 AU away from Earth. That is far! (1AU = distance b/w Earth and Sun) and it still rings back home!
- It contains a **golden record** that was created to encapsulate the essence of humanity and explain it to future alien spacefarers who come across it. So a group of brilliant scientists put together a collection of sounds to accomplish just that.
- It includes **natural sounds**, a **baby's cry**, a **kiss**, **greetings** in a variety of languages, and one whale language. Contains over 100 **analog-encoded visuals** that describe ourselves and what we are.
- A graphic on the record's aluminium cover describes **how to play** it and **where it comes from.**

> "This is a **present** from a **small, distant world,** a token of our sounds, our science, our images, our music, our **thoughts** and our **feelings**. We are attempting to survive our **time** so we may live **into yours**." - President Jimmy Carter on the _Voyager golden record_
