- Justice, according to the Stoics, has <mark>nothing to do with legal matters</mark>.
  It is _not acting in any manner that causes pain or injury to another being._
- The idea of **sympatheia** served as the cornerstone of their understanding of justice.
- Marcus Aurelius wrote:

> "What is not good for the beehive is not good for the bee."

- To achieve great things and to stand up for the people and ideas they valued, the Stoics have pushed for justice throughout history.
