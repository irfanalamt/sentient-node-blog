- Why not apply the same laws that allow humans to coexist and cooperate to AI? **Its not that easy.**
- [Asimov's laws of robotics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Laws_of_Robotics) This set of moral guidelines for robots and intelligent devices had a significant impact on how other authors and thinkers approached the topic.
- In reality, Asimov's laws **dont work**. His laws are based on the assumption that the robots have enough agency to understand and make decisions based on it. He is unconcerned with the less advanced robots, which can think for themselves in simple situations but lack the complexity to make **complex abstract decisions**, and instead focuses on the **advanced futuristic ones**.

#### Some challenges

1.  AI is currently unable to understand the connecting concepts around such laws, such as **‘harm’** and **‘humanity’** and arguably, ‘human’.
2.  When incorrect assumptions are made about the dataset or the model output during the machine learning process, which results in unfair results. **Bias** can occur during the project's design or during the data collection process, resulting in output that unfairly represents the population. There is also a possibilty of **algorithmic bias.**
3.  AI, like any other perfectly functional technology, has the potential for evil and can be used for **malicious purposes**.
4.  We humans itself have differing views on where the ethical lines should be drawn. For eg: The right of a foetus to human life is a hot topic these days. However, in the future, if a pregnant woman has a high risk of dying while giving birth due to a medical condition, should her AI doctor advise abortion? It is important to remember that, while the woman has a better chance of surviving the abortion, the foetus, once born, has more to live for. As a result, the **robot inadvertently harms a human being**.

- As robots become more autonomous and AI surpasses human capabilities in many ways, the need for roboethics standards becomes more pressing.

> ⚡ I **dont think** that AI will turn Ultron and rebel against us. **The risk is that it does exactly what we tell it to do.**
