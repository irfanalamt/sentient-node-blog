Ah, the Moon. It has inspired poets, lovers and adventurers alike since the dawn of human kind.

First of all, it’s worth noting that the Moon is not actually made of cheese, despite the popular belief. It’s actually made of **rocks and mineral deposits** that formed over millions of years. It has no atmosphere, which means there’s no air or water.

What’s more, the Moon’s **gravity is much weaker**(1/6th) than the Earth’s. That’s why astronauts can jump much higher on the Moon than they can here on Earth. It’s also why objects placed on the lunar surface stay there unless they’re disturbed.

The Moon has a wide range of **effects** on Earth's life. It, for example, **regulates the tides** and the length of the day and night. It also has an impact on the weather, influencing how much rain falls. It can also reflect sunlight, resulting in the spectacular phenomenon known as **moonlight**.

But perhaps the most interesting thing about the Moon is that **it always keeps the same side facing us**. This phenomenon is known as **tidal locking**. It’s caused by the gravitational pull of the Earth, which keeps the Moon’s rotation in check.

> ⚡If you're looking for a perfect getaway, perhaps it's best to opt for somewhere a little more temperate than the Moon - preferably one with an atmosphere.
