**Albert Einstein**'s **theory of relativity** changed our understanding of the universe. Prior to its publication in **1905**, the world was stuck in a pre-Einsteinian universe. Scientists had to rely on the work of Isaac Newton in order to explain gravity and motion. But the math didn't add up, and scientists found themselves having to fudge the numbers in order to make it all fit together. That's when Einstein stepped in to save the day.

Einstein proposed that the speed of light is constant and the same for all observers, regardless of their motion. This led to the realization that **time could flow at different speeds in different regions**. He proposed that **gravity** is actually an effect of the **warping of space-time** due to mass, an idea known as the curvature of space-time. This single idea enabled scientists to begin to explain a whole range of effects in the universe, from **quantum mechanics** and particle physics to **black holes**.

Also, Einstein's theory of special relativity showed how **matter and energy** are linked. This led to the development of the famous equation **E=mc^2**, meaning that **matter and energy are simply two forms of the same thing**. This opened the door to previously undiscovered sources of energy such as nuclear power. The implications of this idea were far-reaching, and energy sources such as nuclear power and other alternative sources were explored further.

By revolutionizing our understanding of **time, matter and space**, Einstein changed the way we view our universe.

> âš¡It's no wonder that he is remembered as one of the greatest scientists of all time.
