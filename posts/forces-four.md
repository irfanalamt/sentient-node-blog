ðŸŒŒ**Gravity**

the **anti floating force** that plagues us all. Ever tried to jump too high? Gravity is the one to blame. It prevents us from flying, or even reaching the high shelves in our kitchen. Without it, we would be like astronauts, free falling in the vastness of space, until we are old and grey or until we find something to cling to. It is **less than one-millionth of a millionth of the strength of the strong nuclear force**. Even so, it's the most intuitive, as it **affects all matter**.
<br />
<br />

ðŸŒŒ**Electromagnetic**

The spark that keeps us connected. Electromagnetic force is the force of **attraction or repulsion** between **electrically charged** particles. Without this force, we would not be able to enjoy our favorite electronic devices. It is the force that **enables us to communicate with each other**, to turn on the lights at night, or to enjoy a movie on our laptop.
<br />
<br />

ðŸŒŒ**Strong Nuclear**

The **strongest force** of them all. Strong nuclear force binds protons and neutrons together in an atom. It is the force that **makes the nucleus of an atom stable**. Without it, atoms would fly apart and nothing would exist.
<br />
<br />

ðŸŒŒ**Weak Nuclear**

The force that **allows atoms to change**. The weak nuclear force is responsible for the **decay of certain types of particles**, such as neutrons. It is also responsible for the **transmutation of elements**, allowing them to change from one form to another. Without this force, the universe would be filled with only the lightest elements, like hydrogen and helium.
<br />
<br />

> âš¡An eternal dance of atoms and particles, bound by the **four fundamental forces** of nature. Together, they make up the fabric of our universe.
