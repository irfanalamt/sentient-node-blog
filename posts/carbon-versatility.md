- Carbon's unique chemical properties made all life on Earth possible.
- Has **4 valence electrons**, allowing it to form 4 single bond, 2 double bonds and a triple bond.
- Form **strong bonds** with other atoms including Carbon atoms, this allows for formation of complex molecules like DNA, skin, nutrients.
- All elements in the periodic table column that Carbon occupies also has 4 valence electrons, but the **stability** of the bonds they form is incomparable to Carbon!
- The **hardest substance** (naturally occuring) found on Earth is formed by a Carbon atom bonded with four other Carbon atoms. (Diamond)
