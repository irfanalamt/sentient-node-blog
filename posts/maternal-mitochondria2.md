Our cells' **powerhouses** (the one thing I recall from school), responsible for breaking down food molecules and producing ATP.

But the role of mitochondria doesn't stop there. They also regulate **metabolic activity**, **promote new cell growth** and multiplication, detoxify ammonia in liver cells. Plus, they're involved in building certain parts of our blood and producing hormones like testosterone and estrogen.

They also play a role in **programmed cell death**(apoptosis). A way for the body to rid itself of damaged or unnecessary cells. Without mitochondria, our bodies wouldn't be able to properly regulate this process.

Here's something really cool - because **only female mtDNA** (mitochondrial DNA) is passed on to offspring, it's possible to trace an organism's genetic lineage through its maternal evolutionary line.

> âš¡So next time you're feeling grateful, be sure to give a shoutout to your mom (and her mom, and her mom...) for their **love and mitochondria**.
