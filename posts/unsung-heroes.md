From the depths of the oceans to the shallowest ponds, tiny organisms called **phytoplankton** are found everywhere. But don't let their size fool you - these little critters are **essential to the survival of our planet**.

For those of us unfamiliar with this microscopic organism, phytoplankton are tiny, **one-celled plants**, capable of photosynthesis. They float in and around bodies of water, including oceans, lakes, rivers and streams, and provide much-needed oxygen and food to aquatic life, and especially to marine mammals. In fact, without phytoplankton, earth would be difficult to inhabit.

Perhaps even more noteworthy, phytoplankton are at the **core of the food chain**, helping to feed much of earth's population. Their microscopic size makes them a **primary food source** for a variety of marine life, including small crustaceans, mollusks, krill and fish. As these animals are then consumed by larger fish and other species, the chain is sustained - all thanks to the phytoplankton!

It gets even better! Phytoplankton also help to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, injecting oxygen back into the environment. It's estimated that **almost half of the planet's oxygen** is produced by these remarkable organisms, making them true superheroes in their own right.

But phytoplankton are not just heroes - they are also surprisingly adaptable. Capable of surviving in a variety of environments, including those with changing depths, temperatures, salinity and light conditions, phytoplankton can naturally respond to their surroundings, making them **both resilient and resourceful**.

âš¡Thanks, phytoplankton! You guys rock.
