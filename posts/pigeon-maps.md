- Because of their homing ability, they were ideal for espionage.
  During both World Wars, they were extensively used for this capability.
- They possess both compass(fly in the right direction) and map(compare where they are to where they want to be) mechanisms.
- No one knows exactly how this ability works.
- Some theories that explain part of this process:

  1. Relies upon the position and angle of the Sun.
  2. Use magnetoreception relying on Earth's magnetic field.
  3. Use low-frequency infrasound produced by almost everything, including the oceans and the Earth's crust.

- Incredibly sophisticated bird that passes the "mirror test"! (a test of self-recognition)
