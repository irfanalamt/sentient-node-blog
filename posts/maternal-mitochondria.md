excerpt: "Mitochondria- the cell's powerhouse. Because paternal mitochondria are destroyed shortly after fertilization, we get our mitochondria entirely from our mothers."

- Food molecules are broken down and ATP is synthesised in these organelles in our cells. This ATP is used throughout the cell to carry out many important biological processes that are necessary for the human cell to function properly.

### Functions of mitochondria:

1. **Metabolic activity regulation**.
2. Promotes new **cell growth, cell multiplication**.
3. Detoxifies ammonia in liver cells.
4. Building certain **parts of blood, various hormones**. (testosterone, estrogen)
5. Plays role in **programmed cell death**.
6. Involved in **cell signalling, cell cycle control**.

- Because only **female mtDNA** survives in offspring, it is possible to trace an organism's genetic lineage through its maternal evolutionary line.

> âš¡Thanks mother, for your **_love and mitochondria_**.
