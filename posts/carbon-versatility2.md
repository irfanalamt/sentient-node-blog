Now, I know what you're thinking. "18%? That's not very impressive." But hear me out. Carbon may not be the most abundant element in our bodies, but it's certainly the most important. Without Carbon, we wouldn't be here.

You see, Carbon has these things called **valence electrons**. **Four** to be exact. And these little guys **allow Carbon to form all sorts of bonds** with other atoms. Single bonds, double bonds, even the occasional triple bond. This **versatility** is what makes Carbon so special. It can form **complex molecules** like **DNA, skin, and even nutrients.**

But it's not just Carbon that has four valence electrons. In fact, all the elements in the same column as Carbon on the periodic table have four valence electrons as well. But let's be real, they don't hold a candle to Carbon. I mean, the hardest naturally occurring substance on Earth is formed by a Carbon atom bonded with four other Carbon atoms. And what is that substance, you ask? **Diamonds**. That's right, the hardest substance on Earth is made up of **nothing but Carbon**. Take that, Oxygen.

So the next time you think about your body composition and all that Oxygen floating around, just remember that it's the tiny amount of Carbon that really makes us who we are.

âš¡Carbon: the foundation of all life on Earth and the driving force behind some of the most complex molecules in the universe. Don't underestimate the power of 18%.
