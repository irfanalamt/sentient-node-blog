**Time** is a weird and wonderful thing. It's both a relative concept and a universal one, and it's constantly debated by scientists and philosophers alike. One of the most well-known debates is the A and B theories of time.

⏳**A theory of time**<br/>states that time is **absolute**, meaning it is the same for everyone regardless of their perspective. This theory is based on the idea that **events occur in a linear fashion**.Here, time is like a river, flowing in one continuous direction – forward. Time passes and never stops, moving inexorably into the future. The past has already happened, and the present is constantly evolving, but only through the passage of A theory time. This theory is often associated with **Newtonian physics**.

⏳**B theory of time**<br/>states that time is **relative**. This theory suggests that the past, present, and future all exist at once, and that time is simply an illusion created by our perception of events. Here, time is more like a **momentary snapshot**, with **past, present, and future all existing simultaneously**. This theory is often associated with **Einstein's theory of relativity**.

⚡two theories of time to try and wrap your head around. Go forth and be confused, my friends.
