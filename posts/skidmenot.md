The wonders of friction. Without it, we'd all be careening off into the abyss, unable to turn a wheel or stop on a dime.

Static friction is the **good stuff**. It's the force that keeps your car from sliding all over the place when you make a turn. Without it, driving would be a lot less fun (and a lot more dangerous). But when skidding begins, static friction is lost and dynamic friction takes over.

Dynamic friction is the **weaker force**, and it's what happens when the tire's point of contact is moving relative to the surface. This is why your stopping distance increases when you're skidding. And if that wasn't bad enough, the **stopping distance** is also proportional to the **square of your velocity**. Translation: if you're going twice as fast, your stopping distance is squared. Yikes.

But don't worry, we have the brilliant minds at the anti-lock braking system (**ABS**) to thank for keeping us safe. These computer-controlled procedures keep the **vehicle in the static friction range**, which is much stronger than dynamic friction.

So the next time you're driving and you feel like pushing the limits, just remember: static friction is your friend, and dynamic friction is not. And if all else fails, just âš¡remember the age-old solution: drive slower.
