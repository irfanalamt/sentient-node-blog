When skidding begins, static friction is lost.'

- The engine simply turns and stops the wheel. **Friction** determines when and where.
- When skidding instead of rolling, the tyre's point of contact moves relative to the surface. Here **dynamic friction** takes over.
- The anti-lock braking system(**ABS**) employs computer-controlled methods to maintain this range of **static friction**.
- The stopping distance is increased because dynamic friction has a lower value than static friction.
- The **stopping distance** is proportional to the **square of the velocity**. That is, your stopping distance is squared when you travel twice as fast!
- Best solution: drive slower.
