You know, that pesky little emotion that makes us all feel all warm and fuzzy inside? Yeah, that one.

let's dive into some different philosopher's views on love:

☄️**Plato**: This guy believed that love was all about finding your perfect match, your "other half." He thought that each person had a "soulmate" out there somewhere, and that when you found them, it was like magic. Sounds sweet, right? Wrong. In my opinion, this is just setting people up for disappointment. What if you never find your so-called "soulmate"? Does that mean you're doomed to a life of loneliness and misery? No thanks.

☄️**Aristotle**: This dude had a slightly different take on love. He believed that love was all about giving and receiving, and that it was a mutual exchange between two people. This is a little more realistic than Plato's idea, but still not for me. I mean, come on, relationships shouldn't be about keeping score and tallying up who's doing what for who. That's just setting yourself up for disappointment and resentment.

☄️**Søren Kierkegaard**: Now this guy, he had the right idea. Kierkegaard believed that love was about choice. He said that we choose to love someone, even though they may not always be perfect or meet all of our expectations. In other words, love is a decision, not just an emotion. Now that's something I can get behind.

⚡..and they lived happily ever after...or at least until one of them realized they left the toilet seat up for the millionth time and all hell broke loose.
