- These amazing beings do not just have a single brain; each of their arms contains a mini-brain. Each arm is capable of acting independently(touch, taste, movement).
- They have control over their actions at both the local and central levels.
- They've got three hearts. One heart circulates blood throughout the body, while the other pumps it through the gills to absorb oxygen.
- Largest brain-to-body ratio of any invertibrate. It is also larger than many vertebrates but not mammals.
- Can problem-solve and use tools.
- They can play! Playing is something intelligent animals do.
- Overall, they are fantastic creatures, and it is a privilege to share this planet with them.
