- Contrary to what you might expect, a 100 times heavier animal doesn't require 100 times more energy.
- Kleiber's Law :
  - an animal's metabolic rate scales to the 3‚ÅÑ4 power of the animal's mass.
- This law applies to almost all living things, from blue whales to single cells.
- That is quite impressive because a simple equation can be applied across the animal and plant kingdoms!
- The larger an animal is, the more efficient it is.
