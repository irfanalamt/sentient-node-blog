We might not want to admit it, but **rats and humans** actually share **many similarities** when it comes to the **structure and functions** of their **brains**.

### similarities:

ðŸ§ Composed of the **same four** main parts: the **cerebrum**, the **cerebellum**, the **brain stem**, and the **hypothalamus**. The cerebrum is responsible for higher brain functions such as thought, emotion, and memory. The cerebellum is responsible for motor control. The brain stem regulates autonomic functions such as breathing and heart rate. And the hypothalamus is responsible for regulating hormones.

ðŸ§ Whatâ€™s even more fascinating is that rats and humans share many of the **same neurotransmitters and neural networks in the brain**. Both species have **dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine**, which are all responsible for regulating **emotions and behaviors**. Furthermore, both rats and humans have neural networks that are **connected to the prefrontal cortex**, which is responsible for decision-making and problem-solving.

ðŸ§ Finally, rats and humans also share many of the same behaviors. For example, both species can **learn and remember**, and they both exhibit social behaviors such as **aggression** and **cooperation**. In addition, both species are capable of forming attachments to other individuals.

> âš¡While the differences in our brains are obvious, itâ€™s interesting to note just how similar our brains actually are.
